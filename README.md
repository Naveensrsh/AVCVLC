# AUTOMATIC VEHICLE CONTROL USING VISIBLE LIGHT COMMUNICATION
An Initiative to improve Road Safety


As engineers hoping for a best possible tomorrow hearing a quote from Albert Einstein took our minds to a curve; “Concern for man himself and his safety must always be
for the chief interest of all technical endeavors.” So we took it into our hearts that we should address the safety of humans and put among our top priorities. A domain that raises the question of safety is Roads. Road accidents increase day by day. It proves more hard and tedious to drive at night than during day. And one of the factors that make it mission impossible is bright head lights. Our product titled “Automatic Vehicle Control Using Visible light Communication”; in short AVCVLC, not only mitigates the problem of high
beams but also slows down the vehicle (into which our product is installed) at accident prone areas, like pin-curves, school-hospital areas etc. within the appropriate speed limit as specified by the Road Safety Authority. Our product also carefully monitors traffic lights and sends the details of the vehicle, if it is found that it violates traffic signals.
